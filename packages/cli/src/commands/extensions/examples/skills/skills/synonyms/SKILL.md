This skill helps generate synonyms and alternative expressions for given words or phrases. It provides contextually appropriate alternatives to enhance vocabulary and improve writing variety.

The user provides a word, phrase, or sentence where they need synonym suggestions. They may specify the context, tone, or formality level desired.

## Synonym Generation Guidelines

When generating synonyms, consider:

- **Context**: The specific domain or situation where the word will be used
- **Tone**: Formal, informal, neutral, academic, conversational, etc.
- **Nuance**: Subtle differences in meaning between similar words
- **Register**: Appropriate level of formality for the intended audience

## Output Format

For each input word or phrase, provide:

1. **Direct Synonyms**: Words with nearly identical meanings
2. **Related Alternatives**: Words with similar but slightly different connotations
3. **Context Examples**: Brief usage examples when helpful

## Best Practices

- Prioritize commonly used synonyms over obscure alternatives
- Note any subtle differences in meaning or usage
- Consider regional variations when relevant
- Indicate formality levels (formal/informal/neutral)
- Provide multiple options to give users choices
